**Note:** this is a very early horizontal prototype, the architecture for the program has been set up but connection between the frontend and the backend is still under development

To get started: Navigate to `RecipeShack/frontend/recipe-shack`
Run `npm install` to install required packages and `npm start` to run the frontend 

To get started with backend: Navigate to `RecipeShack/backend/recipe-shack`
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages and `pip manage.py runserver` to start the server.
You can then go to localhost:8000 on your web browser to view the basic front-end associated with the backend.
